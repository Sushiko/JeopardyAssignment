/**
 * JClient.java
 *
 * This program implements a simple multithreaded chat client.  It connects to the
 * server (assumed to be localhost on port 7654) and starts two threads:
 * one for listening for data sent from the server, and another that waits
 * for the user to type something in that will be sent to the server.
 * Anything sent to the server is broadcast to all clients.
 *
 * The JClient uses a ClientListener whose code is in a separate file.
 * The ClientListener runs in a separate thread, recieves messages form the server,
 * and displays them on the screen.
 *
 * Data received is sent to the output screen, so it is possible that as
 * a user is typing in information a message from the server will be
 * inserted.
